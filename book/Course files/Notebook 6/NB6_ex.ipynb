Normally the period of a mass-spring system is given by: $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{C}}$. Here $m$ is the mass and $C$ is the spring constant. However this formula assumes that you have a massless spring, this is not true unfortunately. This means that the mass of the spring is also vibrating, we should thus change the formula to take this into account. This gives the following equation: $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m + \\Delta m}{C}}$, where $\\Delta m$ is the systematic error.\n",
