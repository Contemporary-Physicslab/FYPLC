    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics experiments, you try to determine relationships or certain values as accurately as possible. What “as accurately as possible” actually means remains unclear for now. What is hopefully clear right away is that we can almost never determine those values directly. We conduct various experiments to collect data that we can use to determine the relationship and then establish the various parameters in that relationship as accurately as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is never possible to determine the exact value(s) of those parameters: with each new measurement, there will be small fluctuations (especially if you measure very precisely). Over time, we have been able to improve our experiments and take more measurements in less time. This means that, over the course of history, constants such as Planck's constant have been determined with increasing accuracy and that the value has varied over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequence of never being able to determine a value precisely is that when you work with that value, your final answer will never be perfect (determined). It will always be uncertain what the exact value actually is. In this chapter, you will learn how the uncertainty in a measured value affects the final result (you already know the basics, significant figures and associated calculation rules), and how to minimize that uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The terms *measurement error* and *measurement uncertainty* are often used interchangeably. In many cases, measurement uncertainty would be a more accurate description of the situation. A measurement error implies that you are doing something truly *wrong*, without being able to do anything about it. The error arises inherently from the use of an instrument, from the measurement itself. In that case, it would be more accurate to talk about uncertainty. Although we try to make a careful distinction here, in general language use the two terms are often unintentionally interchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete data analysis will often consist of the following three phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  determining the reliability of individual measurements and the dataset as a whole;\n",
    "2.  finding and determining the pattern in the data, including determining the variables with their associated uncertainties;\n",
    "3.  an optimal data (re)presentation to convince of phases 1 & 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this part of the physics practical is to develop a deeper understanding of the above phases and to learn how to apply the associated techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantities, units, dimension-analysis and constants\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, we measure physical quantities. We distinguish between vectors (quantities with a direction $\\vec{F}$ (N)) and scalars (quantities with only a value ($m (\\mathrm{kg})$)). The quantity is written in italics ($U$), with the corresponding unit in upright type ($\\mathrm{V}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five commonly used standard units ($\\mathrm{kg, m, s, K, C}$). There is also a sixth standard unit that you encounter less often ($\\mathrm{cd}$). All other units are derived from these standard units. The derivation of the unit is based on the formula:\n",

    "$P = F\\cdot v$\\\n",
    "$[\\mathrm{J/s}] = [\\mathrm{kg m s}^{-2}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{m s}^{-1}] = [\\mathrm{kg m}^{2} \\mathrm{s}^{-3}]$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, based on units (dimensional analysis), you can derive formulas if you know which quantities may play a role. This will be discussed in much greater depth in the second-year course Physical Transport Phenomena. \n",
    "Would you like to know how to perform a dimensional analysis? Then take a look at this video:\n",

    "### Systematic error\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to influencing the measurement of your physical quantity by measuring it, there are other causes that can lead to ‘errors’. We distinguish between *systematic errors* and *random errors*. A systematic error will always be the same size, and therefore causes a deviation in your average result. Such an error strongly influences your final result. Fortunately, you can correct for this type of error. Examples of systematic errors are a zero point error and a calibration error, see for example {numref}`Figure {number} <fig:MO:sysfout>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "This creates a systematic error if you are not aware that the ruler does not start at 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out whether there is a systematic error in your data, you can check this using Python, for example. This is best explained using an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example: Systematic error\n",
    ":class: dropdown, tip\n",
    "You are conducting research into the influence of distance on force. To do this, you measure the distance, but you are concerned that there may be a systematic error in the distance $r$ because that distance cannot be measured accurately. If you investigate the expected relationship $F = \\frac{a}{r^4}$, you can try to fit the function $F = \\frac{a}{(r+\\Delta r)^4}$. In the ideal situation, without systematic error, $\\Delta r$ is equal to 0. If this formula produces a better fit for $\\Delta r \\neq 0$ ({numref}`Figure {number} <fig:systematic_error_fit>`), then $\\Delta r$ may be your systematic error. Of course, you then need to investigate whether this value is reasonable and can be explained.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In {numref}`Figure {number} <fig:systematic_error_fit>`, you can see the difference between a fit with and without compensation for systematic error. Although the upper figure appears to be a good fit, you can see that the fit in the lower figure is even better across all measurements. Later, we will look at how we can investigate such errors more systematically.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random error\n",
    "\n",
    "A random measurement error can arise due to, for example, temperature fluctuations, vibrations, air currents, collisions at the molecular level, etc. This is referred to as a *technical* random error. These uncertainties cannot always be reduced. Random errors can be both positive and negative, and therefore average out if you take enough measurements. You can work with them and calculate them because they are based on a probability distribution. In the following sections, we assume that you are always dealing with a random error, i.e., an error that is not correlated with other variables and for which the probability of that error occurring is *normally (Gaussian) distributed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to technical random errors, you may encounter fundamental errors due to physical limitations on some measurements, for example due to [thermal fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise) when measuring currents. This is referred to as a *fundamental* random error. This contribution to the measurement uncertainty cannot be reduced. The contribution to the total uncertainty can be either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instrumental uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "Every instrument you use has certain limitations. The uncertainty may be dependent on reading the instrument, but also on the instrument itself, or on the value of the measured quantity. In addition, you must first calibrate (some) instruments before using them. An error in calibration can lead to a systematic error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using instruments, the terms *precision* and *accuracy* are often used. Precision refers to the small spread in the measurements. Precision is closely related to random errors. Accuracy refers to how close the measurements are to the desired value. Accuracy is closely related to systematic errors. The four variants that you can have are shown in {numref}`Figure {number} <fig:MO:precision>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} Figures/precision.png\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Measuring scales \n",
    ":class: dropdown, note\n",
    "\n",
    "Different measuring instruments have different measuring scales. We distinguish between nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, and cardinal scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Nominal scale**\\\n",
    "If we only name the quality of the object, the measuring scale is called nominal. Determining the color of a solution is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Ordinal scale**\\\n",
    "If the designation involves a ranking, we refer to an ordinal scale. An example is giving grades for academic performance. Someone with a 10 knows more than someone with a 5, but that person does not know twice as much. Also, the difference in knowledge between a 5 and a 6 is usually incomparable to the difference between a 9 and a 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Interval scale**\\\n",
    "A scale on which equal differences mean the same thing but ratios do not, is called an interval scale. On an interval scale, the zero point is arbitrary. The Celsius scale is an example of this. 100 ˚C is not twice as high a temperature as 50 ˚C, but the temperature difference between 50 ˚C and 51 ˚C is the same as between 100 ˚C and 101 ˚C.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Ratio scale**\\\n",
    "If, in addition to differences, we can also use ratios of measurement results in a meaningful way, then the measurement takes place on a ratio scale. Measuring lengths is an example. A table that is 2 m wide is twice as wide as a table that is 1 m wide. We strive to bring measurement to the level of a ratio scale. An example is the transition from the Celsius scale to the absolute temperature scale (the Kelvin scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Cardinal scale**\\\n",
    "The fact that we can measure on an interval scale with a fixed zero point or on a ratio scale does not determine the numerical values. Only when we have chosen the unit (for Celsius temperatures the ˚C, for lengths for example the meter) can we assign numerical values. We then speak of a cardinal scale.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement uncertainty in analog instruments**\\\n",
    "With analog instruments, you have to read the value, see {numref}`Figure {number} <fig:MO:aflezen>`. In some cases, there is a mirror behind the pointer so that you don't make a mistake by reading the pointer at an angle. Furthermore, you cannot read the value with infinite precision. Think of a measuring stick that allows you to measure accurately to the nearest millimeter, but where distances between millimeters cannot be determined accurately, especially when the lines on the ruler are thick. When reading an analog meter, you must estimate the associated uncertainty:\n",
    "* Read the value as accurately as possible. \n",
    "* Determine the values that you can still read *accurately*.\n",
    "* Then take half of the difference between two values that you can accurately read as a measure of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example: Interpolating readings\n",
    ":class: dropdown, tip\n",
    "The best reading of the pointer in {numref}`Figure {number} <fig:MO:aflezen>` would be 17.3. The value is clearly between 17 and 17.5, closer to 17.5 than 17. The values 17 and 17.5 would be easy to read. Half of that is 0.25. The uncertainty is then 0.3 (we are not allowed to round down an uncertainty).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "One advantage of the Calculus method over the Functional Approach is that you can dimension your experiment: based on predefined criteria, you can specify how large the experiment should be, what characteristics it should have, and where most of the time and attention should be focused in order for it to meet the set criteria. The easiest way to explain this is with an example.\n",

However, you want to know the exact mass of each weight, accurate to the nearest gram. The maximum relative uncertainty is therefore 2%. What does the experiment look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass of the mass-spring system is calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = \\frac{CT^2}{4\\pi^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "De onzekerheid in de massa wordt daarmee gegeven door:\n",

    "We often measure a quantity as a function of another quantity, for example, the extension of a spring as a function of the spring load or the period of oscillation as a function of the length of the pendulum. The purpose of this can vary. For example, we may ask ourselves: *How (according to which functional relationship) does the elongation depend on the load?* Or: *What is the spring constant of the spring?* We then assume a certain relationship and use that relationship to determine the values of parameters. In the first case, we refer to this as modeling, and in the second case, as adjusting or “fitting.” In statistics, the second case is known as a regression problem. We will discuss this in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting is a procedure that attempts to find a mathematical relationship in a number of (measurement) points. We are then looking for a relationship $F(x)$ that describes the measurement points $M(x)$ in such a way that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) - M(x)\\approx 0$$ (eq:resid)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to choose a type of relationship. Examples include a linear fit, a polynomial, sine, etc. In the fitting procedure itself, the parameters of this relationship are chosen so that they best match the data. For example, if a second-order polynomial is being fitted, you look for the combination of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that ensures that the curve $a + bx + cx^2$ fits your measurement points as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used method for determining the *goodness* of a fit is the *least-squares* method. In this method, the sum of the squared distances from the measurement points to the fit is minimized. To do this, we first define the distance between the measurement point and the fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_i = M_i - F_i$$ (eq:resid2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This distance is also referred to as the residue, which we will discuss in more detail later. The total sum of the absolute distances must be as small as possible:\n",

    "In the above case, we assume that the value of the independent variable has been determined with sufficient accuracy and precision. There are other techniques that take into account the deviation in the dependent variable. We can also look again at the influence of measurement uncertainty in determining the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted fit\n",
    "Just as a weighted average takes into account the uncertainty in the measurement, you can use a weighted fit for a function fit. This allows you to take into account the uncertainty in the dependent variable (there is also a technique that takes into account the uncertainty in both the independent and dependent variables, but we will not discuss that here).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a weighted fit, the smallest value for $\\chi^2$ is considered, taking the uncertainty into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(M_i-F_i)^2 }{u(M_i)^2} $$ (eq:chi2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other fit types\n",
    "\n",
    "With a least-squares fit, we try to minimize the residual (squared). This works particularly well under the assumption that the uncertainty lies in the dependent variable. We are therefore able to set the independent variable ourselves, or reduce the uncertainty to such an extent that it can be neglected in relation to the uncertainty in the dependent variable. However, the least-squares method is not the only method. There is also, for example, the ‘orthogonal distance regression’ method, or smallest distance method. The method is visualized in {numref}`Figure {number} <fig:ODR>`. We will not provide the further mathematical elaboration here, but how the method can be implemented can be found in this [source](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/odr.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "When experimenting, the goal is often to discover the relationship between two variables. In many cases, this relationship is not linear, for example between the swing time and length of a pendulum. In such cases, it is useful to linearize the graphs. Firstly, this makes it easier to see deviations, and secondly, it also makes fitting easier.\n",

    "### Agreement analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important reasons for determining uncertainty is that you want to compare results with each other or with theoretical predictions systematically and quantitatively, and thus determine the extent to which the values differ from each other. The question then is: ‘To what extent do the empirically found values correspond with \\...’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to compare two values $a$ and $b$, each with their own uncertainty $u(a)$ and $u(b)$. Then we first want to look at the\n",
    "difference between these two values: $v = a- b$. Based on the calculus approach, the uncertainty in $v$ is given by $u(v) = \\sqrt{u(a)^2 + u(b)^2}$. The agreement now is that two values are inconsistent with each other (in a scientific sense, they do not correspond sufficiently with each other) if the following applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lvert v \\rvert = \\lvert a - b \\rvert > 2\\sqrt{u(a)^2 + u(b)^2} = 2u(v)$$ (eq:agreement)\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining physical constants, the uncertainty is often so small that it is negligible compared to other uncertainties. Please note! You could argue that if your measurement uncertainty is large enough, the values will never be contradictory. However, when the uncertainty is relatively large compared to the determined value, the values found have little scientific value.\n",
